Operator Overloading:

- Operator Overloading is also an approach defining multiple 
behaviours to an operator and those behaviours will vary 
based on the operand types betwen which the operator is used.

	Number + Number =>Addition
	String + String => concatenation

- Method overloading is a approach of defining multiple 
behaviours to a method and thse behaviours will vary 
based on the paremeters
of that method.

String str = "Hello How are you"?
str.Substring(14); you
str.Substring(10); are you
str.Substring(10,3); are


Matrix:

Matrix m1 = new Matrix(20,18,16,14);
Matrix m2 = new Matrix(10,8,6,4);
Matrix m3 = m1 + m2;

Matrix m3 = new Matrix(m1.a + m2.a,m1.b +m2.b,m1.c+m2.c,m1.d+m2.d);



public static Matrix operator +(Matrix obj1, Matrix obj2)
{

}

// internal WriteLine
public static void WriteLine(Obejct value)
{
string TypeName = value.ToString();
