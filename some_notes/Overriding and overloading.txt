method Overriding:
-It's an approach of re-implementing a parent classes method under
the child class with the same signature.

class1
show()
show(int i)
Test()

class2 : class1
show(string i)
Test()

Overloading:
1. In this case we difine multiple methods with the same name by 
changing their parameters.
2. This can be performed either within a class as well as between 
parent child classes also.
3. While overloading a parenet classes method under the child class,
, child class doesn't require to take any permission from 
the parent class.
4. overloading is all about defining multiple behaviours
to a method.

Overriding:
1. In this case we define multiple methods with teh same name and same 
parameters.
2.This can be performed only between parenet child classes and never
be performed with in the same class.
3. while overriding a parent's  method under child class, child class
requires a permission from it's parent.
4.overriding is all about changing the behaviour of parent's method 
under child class.

Note: if we want to override a parent's method under the child class first 
the mehtod should be declared by using the virtual odifier 
in parent class.

class1 
public virtural void Test()// Override

-any virtual mehtod of the parent class can be overriden by the childif required by 
usign the override modifier.


class2 : class1
public override void Test()  // overriding
