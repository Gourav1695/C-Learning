5. QueryContext.cs inside RequestContext.cs
6. Read about queryanylysiscontext part
7. EntityTypeRequired -
8. AutoCompletProvider -> Enhance auto complte provider is to giv auto complete text suggestions
 for keywords like from/ to/ About / With?In etc based on the query already typed.These can be suggested based on
prefix match along with the below condition.
 --> "From" can be suggest as ZQ auto complete. --> what is ZQ??
--> "About" can be suggested if a person is already selected and the query has " From" or "To" keywords.
-->"In" keyword can be suggested with chats/ teams/channels to search within a particular channel
--> "On" keyword should give the data ranges as suggestions. ie Today/Last 7days etc.
