Method Hiding/Shadowing:

-Method overriding is an approach of re-implemeting a 
parent classes method under the child class exactly with the same
name and signature.

- Method Hiding/shadowing is also an approach of re-implementing 
a parent classes method under the child class exactly with
the same name and signature.

-In the first case child class re-implements it's parent's methods which are declared as vi
as virtual , Where as in the second case 
child class can re-implent any parent's method even if the method is not declared as virtual.

- After re-implementing parent classes methods under child classes
the child class instance will start calling the local methods only that is 
the re-implemented methods, but if required in any case we can also call 
the parent classes methods from child classes by 
using 2 approaches.

1. By creating the intance of parent class under child class we can call parent's methods
from child class.

2. By using the base keyword also we can call parent's method from child class.
 but keywords like this and base can't be used from static blocks.


-- A parent clas refernce eve if created by using the child class
instance can't access any members that are purely defined under the child clas but can call overriden
 members of child class, because overriden members are not considered as pure
 child class members , but members which are re-implemented by sung the approach of hiding are considered
as pure child class members and not accessible to parent's references.
